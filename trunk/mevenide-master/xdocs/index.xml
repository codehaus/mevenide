    	Mevenide (Maven IDE Integration) aims at integrating Maven into standard IDEs.
    	Currently only Eclipse is targeted. 
    </p>
    <p>
    	Mevenide is a work in progress ; see the current <a href="status.html">status</a>.
    	Putting the site into CVS is perhaps bad practice, however it is yet quite practice yo share ideas. 
    	We should put a wiki already put a wiki on <a href="http://mevenide.sf.net">mevenide.sf.net</a> to share ideas.
