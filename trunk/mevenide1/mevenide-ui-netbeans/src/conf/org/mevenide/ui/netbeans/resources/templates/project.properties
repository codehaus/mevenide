# Here you can place project specific properties for maven, which will
# influence the maven build behaviour
# 
# For Example:
# maven.xdoc.includeProjectDocumentation = yes
#          is a property of the xdoc plugin and will make maven to include project docs.
# or
# maven.test.skip=true
#     when there are no tests.
# for a complete list of properties for each plugin, 
#    see http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/index.html
