		    <subsection name="Downloading">
			<div id="documentContent">
			  <p>You can download the package for this OpenTool <a href="/release/jbuilder/">here</a></p>
			  <p>The latest version is <strong>0.2</strong></p>
			</div>
		    </subsection>
		
		  <subsection name="Installing">
			<div id="documentContent">
			<p>Installation is pretty straight forward:</p>
			<ul>
			  <li>Copy the maven-ui-jbuilder-VERSION.jar file into the JBuilderVERSION/lib/ext directory</li>
			</ul>
			</div>
		  </subsection>
			<subsection name="Using the Maven OpenTool">
				<div id="documentContent">
				<p>This tool works a lot like the existing Ant integration that JBuilder
				includes in version 7 and above.</p>
				<ol>
				<li>Add your <code>project.xml</code> project file to your JBuilder project</li>
				<li>The tool will then recognize all the available plugins for your project
					and will display them as children of the Maven project file.</li>
				<li>If you right-click on the project.xml file, you can set options when 
				    Maven will get executed, such as activating debug mode or offline mode.</li>
				<li>You can right-click on any goal (you can't right click on plugins) and
					execute the goal selected by clicking on "Make"
				</li>
				<li>You can also set a maven goal as a "Build Target" in the RunTime
					configuration menu, and it will be launched just before the application
					gets started when you run your project (useful for deployment for
					example)
				</li>
				</ol>
