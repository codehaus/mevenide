Hello World Web Application

 <<Please note: The sources for NetBeans Maven support have been moved to netbeans.org. Any tutorials referenced

  This simple tutorial will show you how to create a simple web application using mevenide2-netbeans. After the application will be created, we will run it using the Bundled Tomcat server launched by Netbeans IDE, and seen the result in your favourite browser.

  For convenience reason, we use here the Bundled Tomcat Server provided by default in Netbeans, but, it is possible to use other web containers.

* Prerequisite

  * {{{http://www.netbeans.org}Netbeans5.0}} or later installed

  * {{{../installation.html}Mevenide2.2}} for Netbeans installed

  Yes, "helloWorldWebApp" can be an appropriate name for our web application.

  [[5]] The project archetype is builded succesfully. And you can navigate to see the jsp source

  You can find the webapp structure in the "projects" tab.

  [[6]] Rickt click on the project, select the "Run" menu item. That will launch the Bundled Tomcat Server and deploy the Webapp.

    Here you can use the HTTPMonitor, which helps to see the communication between the client browser and the Bundled Tomcat Server.

  [[8]] You can watch the result in the browser:

  [[9]] Now developments are finished, we want to generate a Web Archive (.war)

  Rickt click on the project, select the "Build" menu item. It will generate in the target folder the war artifact, <<<helloWorldWebApp.war>>>


* To conclude 

  Is there a simpler manner to begin in web application development ?
