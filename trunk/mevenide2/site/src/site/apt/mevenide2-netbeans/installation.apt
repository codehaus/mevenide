Installation 

 <<Please note: The sources for NetBeans Maven support have been moved to netbeans.org. Any tutorials referenced
from this site might be outdated and not reflecting the current UI and feature set in NetBeans 6.5 and beyond.>>

* Prerequisite

  * The support for Maven2 only works in <<Netbeans 5.0>> and <<later>> builds. No support for 4.1 and older versions is planned currently.

  * It doesn't require Maven2 to be installed on your machine. If it's there though, the IDE will share the settings. The Maven Embedder that ships with Mevenide is of version 2.1 snapshot, with additional not yet integrated patches.

* Netbeans 6.0 Installation 

** Install using the Netbeans Update Center

  [[1]] Go to the Netbeans menu and select the Tools/Plugins menu item

  [[2]] In the Plugins panel select the "Available plugins" tab.

  [[3]] Use the "maven" keyword for search :

  [[4]] Check at least the "Maven" plugin install. Others are optional but can be very useful for maven java entreprise support. 
In NetBeans 6.0, the Maven Enterprise support gets automatically installed for you if both Maven and J2ee modules are installed.
