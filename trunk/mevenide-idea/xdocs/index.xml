            <p>
                Welcome to the MevenIDE IDEA Integration project! This project
                aims to integrate
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> in every possible way into
                <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrain</a>'s IntelliJ IDEA integrated
                development environment (IDE).
            </p>
            <p>
                Current integration features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        An initial POM graphical and text editors (still in progress).
                        The editors are synchronized with changes from outside the IDE,
                        as well as inside the IDE.
                    </li>
                    <li>Specifying a POM file on a per-module basis.</li>
                    <li>
                        An Ant-like tool window displaying each IDEA module's available
                        goals, as defined in the project or module's <i>maven.xml</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Execution of selected goal(s) in a dedicated execution console,
                        much like the standard <i>Run</i>console of IDEA. Each execution
                        can be stopped or paused, and output can be copied and exported.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Specifying a different Maven home than the one defined in your
                        <i>MAVEN_HOME</i>environment variable and PATH, as well as
                        auto-detection of your Maven home (via the MAVEN_HOME variable).
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The following is a (partial) list of features we intend to be implementing over
                the coming months:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bidirectional update between IDEA project and POM</li>
                    <li>A wizard for opening+creating IDEA project from a POM</li>
                    <li>Autolaunch goals on specific project events (compilation, etc)</li>
                    <li>Automatic artifact downloading on need (on project open?)</li>
                    <li>
                        Browinsg of both remote and local repositories, as well as manually
                        downloading artifacts to the local repository. Searching the repositories
                        for an artifact is also planned.
                    </li>
                    <li>POM text file editor (instead of the UI editor) with smart intellisense.
                    </li>
                    <li>Jelly script file editor with smart intellisense.</li>
                    <li>Goal searching based on text, dependencies, etc.</li>
                    <li>A wizard for creating a POM from an existing IDEA project.</li>
                    <li>A POM strucutre tree.</li>
                    <li>POM templates.</li>
                </ul>

                Currently, no version has been released yet. The 0.1 release is well
                underway and should be released in the coming weeks. Until then, you
                are more than welcome to try the snapshot build located
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/mevenide/distributions/mevenide-idea-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip">here</a>.
                To install it - simply unzip it into your IDEA <i>plugins</i> directory.
            </p>

                Currently the plugin is only supported on the IntelliJ IDEA Early
                Access Program (EAP) dubbed "Irida". It cannot be run on the
                4.5 version.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is, however, a port of the plugin for the 4.5 version
                with provides the basic features such as per-module POM
                attachment, favorite goals, running goals and jumping to
                source code from Maven error messages. It is available
                <a href="http://www.codehaus.org/~arik/dist/mevenide-idea-4.5.4.zip">here</a>.
                <br/>
                NOTE: This is a source code distribution, and you will have to build it from
                source code. If you do, make sure you compile the classes using IDEA, since
                the plugin utilizes the IDEA UI designer, which injects bytecode into the
                classes. There is an Ant script inside, but it does not perform the code
                injection, and you will get exceptions. The Ant script DOES, however, provide
                an Ant task for it, but does not activate it.
