                Features we want to (eventually) support in the IDEA plugin (note: some

                        the POM. It should be a simple text editor, with Jelly namespace

                        We should also provide sensible defaults for this (but only after
                        user saw them - as this can cause unwanted results if defaults are
                        wrong).

                        Assuming the dependencies and IDEA libraries are synchronized,
                        we should always initiate a dependency update on project open
                        or when initiated by the user, to make sure project compiles
                        in the IDE to the correct classpath.

                        Add a new IDEA project type - "Maven Plugin". This will make
                        creating Maven plugins a snap. Project type should automaticaly
                        create the appropriate project.xml, plugin.properties, project.properties,
                        resources, etc for the developer. Also automatically activate

                        at least provide a nice user-friendly text editor, that has a panel
