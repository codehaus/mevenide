        <release version="0.1" date="unreleased" description="">
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added reports selection to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added testing information to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added build information to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added SCM UI to the POM editor. Editor allows editing of project versions, branches and SCM repository.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added developers and contributors UI to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added mailing lists UI to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added dependency UI to the POM editor.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added manual installation instructions.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added an initial version of the graphical POM editor.
                Currently, only a small subset of the POM properties are supported, but they will
                grow very soon.
                <p>The editor works closely with the IDEA API so that save and load operations are
                    treated the same as standard file operations. The POM editor is also constantly
                    synchronized with the underlying file, so that editing the file with the POM
                    text editor (also provided) or even from outside the IDE will synchronize the
                    graphical editor, and vice-versa.</p>
                <p>Synchronization with the IDEA project and module settings is not yet
                    implemented.</p>
            </action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="update">POM selection for modules has been removed. POM
                files are now automatically detected by searching for files named 'project.xml' in
                every module file's directory.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Try to guess Maven home on startup, if not set by the
                user.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="fix">Fixed exception that occured when adding new modules
                with no POM attached.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added custom icons for goals and plugins in
                trees.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="update">Upgraded plugin to JDK 1.5 - required by IDEA since
                build 3311.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="remove">Removed the GoalsProvider interface in favor of
                direct use of IGoalsGrabber. This is now possible since the UI elements can interact
                with mevenide objects (see next jdom issue for details).</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="update">JetBrains has upgraded the JDOM version they use in
                the IDE from 0.8 to 1.0, which enables us now to restore the original plugin
                architecture to a single Maven project and remove the custom class loader
                implementation since it is no longer needed. Therefor, reintegrated
                <i>mevenide-idea-main</i>,
                <i>mevenide-idea-model</i>and
                <i>mevenide-idea-master</i>back into a single project called
                <i>mevenide-idea</i>.
            </action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Automatically update goals tree if either the
                <i>maven.xml</i> or
                <i>project.xml</i> files are changed. Synchronization will occur whether the change
                came from inside the IDE (e.g. the user has edited the files) or from outside the
                IDE (e.g. opening notepad and manually modifying the files).
            </action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Showing goal descriptions in Goals tool
                window/pane.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Added a short installation guide.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="update">Split project into subprojects:
                <ul>
                    <li>mevenide-idea-master: a template parent project for the other modules</li>
                    <li>mevenide-idea-main: the main project - provides the UI and plugin
                        wrapper.</li>
                    <li>mevenide-idea-model: interacts with mevenide and exposes project information
                        for the mevenide-idea-main module.</li>
                </ul>
            </action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="update">Modified code base to use Mevenide libraries
                instead of custom code that does the same.</action>
            <action dev="arikkfir" type="add">Created initial code base of the plugin. Current code
                supports:
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying a POM file on a per-module basis.</li>
                    <li>Specifying "favorite" goals for each module, for easy access.</li>
                    <li>An Ant-like tool window displaying each IDEA module's available goals, as
                        defined in
                        <i>maven.xml</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>Execution of selected goal(s) in a dedicated execution console, much like
                        the standard
                        <i>Run</i> console of IDEA. Each execution can be stopped, or paused.
                    </li>
                    <li>Specifying a different Maven home than the one defined in your
                        <i>MAVEN_HOME</i> environment variable and PATH.
                    </li>
                </ul>
