      <answer>
      	<p>
        	If you're experimenting such kind of problems, <i>please</i> provide relevant informations,
        	f.i. by sending some log (e.g. ${workspace.dir}/.metadata/.log or looking at the error view, located under 
        	Window/Show View/Other.../Pde Runtime). Also make sure Mevenide isnot actually loaded by looking at the Plugin Registry (same path than the error log).
        </p>
        <p>
        	Tho often the root of the problem is that dependency requirements are not fullfilled, 
        	f.i. you should have ajde installed. If it is not, you can download it at <a href="http://eclipse.org/ajdt">AJDT website</a>.
        </p>

	        We will in the near future provide a site.xml descriptor to make the install easier.
