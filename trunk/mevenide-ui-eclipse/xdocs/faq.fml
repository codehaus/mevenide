      <question>How do i install Mevenide for Eclipse ? </question>
      <answer>
      	<p>
        	If you got the release as a jar then you just have to unzip into your Eclipse install directory. This will add one feature and five plugins (org.mevenide.*).
        	<br/> If you used the Eclipse update manager, then nothing else is required.

      <question>Mevenide doesnot work !!!</question>
      <answer>
      	<p>
        	If you're experimenting such kind of problems, <i>please</i> provide relevant informations,
        	f.i. by sending some log (e.g. ${workspace.dir}/.metadata/.log or looking at the error view, located under 
        	Window/Show View/Other.../Pde Runtime). Also make sure Mevenide isnot actually loaded by looking at the Plugin Registry (same path than the error log).
