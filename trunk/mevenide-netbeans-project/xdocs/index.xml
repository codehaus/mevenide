        <p> This project allows to open and work with maven projects in upcoming Netbeans IDE 4.0. See the 
        <a href="features.html" class="documentLink">features list</a>  <!-- and the <a href="help.html" class="documentLink">Help page</a> -->
	    to learn more about Mevenide for Netbeans IDE. </p>
        <p>
        It works with development builds of Netbeans 4.0, JDK 1.4.1 and Maven 1.0-rc2. 
        To get the Netbeans builds, go to the <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/downloads/ide/archive/builds_archive_dev.html"> download page </a>
        Mevenide  was tested with build 200405191800.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are using previous versions of Netbeans (3.5.1 and 3.6), please check the
        The <a href="../download/mevenide-ui-netbeans-0-1-SNAPSHOT.zip" class="documentLink"> snapshot release of Mevenide for Netbeans 3.x</a>. It features basic integration within the 3.x framework.
        However it's not actively developed anymore. The upcoming 4.0 is where the development focus goes now.
        </p>
        <p> There is another Netbeans module that adds code completion to Maven related xml files. It's complementary to this module but can be used separately, works also in Netbeans 3.6.
