            <p>Mevenide for the 4.0 version and upcoming 4.1 version contains these <a href="features.html" class="documentLink"> features </a>.</p>
            <p> You can download the <a href="../download/mevenide-netbeans-0.5.zip"> 0.5 release</a>. It was tested with Maven 1.0.2 and Netbeans IDE 4.0 final and 4.1 beta.
            Reasonable effort is made to have it always working with the latest development builds of Netbeans 4.1. Please note that the grammar module (completion for maven xml files) in 0.6 release zip will work
            with the 4.0 but to get it working with 4.1 you need the <a href="../nbm_release/mevenide-netbeans-grammar-0.6.1.nbm">updated 4.1 nbm </a>.
            To get the latest Netbeans builds, go to the <a href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?a=n&amp;p=1"> download page </a> </p>
