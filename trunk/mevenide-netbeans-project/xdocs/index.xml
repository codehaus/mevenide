            <p>Mevenide for the upcoming 4.0 version contains these <a href="features.html" class="documentLink"> features </a>.</p>
            <p> You can download the <a href="../download/mevenide-netbeans-0.4.zip"> 0.4 release</a>. It was tested with Maven 1.0.1 and Netbeans IDE 4.0 RC1.
            Reasonable effort is made to have it always working with the latest development builds of Netbeans 4.0. Please note that the grammar module (completion for maven xml files) for 0.4 release will work
            with the RC1 but not with the old beta2. You are encouraged to upgrade. 
            To get the latest Netbeans builds, go to the <a href="http://www.netbeans.info/downloads/download.php?a=n&amp;p=1"> download page </a> </p>
