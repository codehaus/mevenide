  	<p>This document is work in progress. It should be kept in synch with the code as most as possible, providing a good 
  		starting point for developers who want to contribute. It describes <a href="">mevenide-core</a> architecture, which is quite stable now.
  		However i dont think that the diagrams that are already present are not really useful. Indeed they miss some interactivity (they should be clickable, 
  		like Rose generated sites). For now i guess you will find the Javadoc more descriptive :/
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		i used <a href="http://www.omondo.com">Omondo Eclipse plugin</a> to generate the UML Stuff. but i think to switch to Rose in the near future.	
  		Indeed omondo isnot yet as flewible as we would like it to be (in particular router algorithms are not quite efficient yet), and more disturbing, 
  		it doesnt save the layout ! tho perhaps i have missed something here. 
  		If you have any input about that issue, please let me know.

  <section name="Maven Runner">
  	<p>
  		The sequence diagram below describes the sequence of actions that is used to launch a Maven process. <code>initEnvironment()</code> and <code>launchVM()</code> are abstract methods  
  		that concrete plugin implementations have to implement.
