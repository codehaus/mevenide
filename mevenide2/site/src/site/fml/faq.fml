   <faq id="question1">
     <question>How do I setup the project to use JDK other than the default?</question>
     <answer>
The current Maven solution to the problem is to run the Maven build with a different JDK. That's not suitable for IDE use. 
<a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/MAVEN/Toolchains">Toolchains proposal</a> shall make the use of JDK configurable. In the mean time
you can only have the project compiled with different JDK by running with external command-line Maven
instance that used the desired JDK. To get the correct code completion and hints in the IDE's editor,
check the <a href="mevenide2-netbeans/customizations.html">netbeans.hint.jdkPlatform</a> property.

   <faq id="question2">
     <question>Why cannot I run/debug my project?</question>
     <answer>
A possible reason is that the IDE doesn't know how to handle your project's packaging and doesn't include
default IDE action mappings. To check, go to project's Properties dialog and examine the Actions tab and it's
mappings to default actions. You can define the missing entries there. Alternatively you can set the <a href="mevenide2-netbeans/customizations.html">netbeans.hint.packaging</a> property
to let the IDE handle the project as being of a default packaging (if a custom packaging is the cause of the problem).
     </answer>
   </faq>
   <faq id="question3">
     <question>Why cannot I debug my test?</question>
     <answer>
Check previous entry for possible problems with mappings. When the build starts, but the breakpoint is not reached,
you probably encountered issue <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEVENIDE-435">MEVENIDE-435</a>. Check it's description for a workaround.

   <faq id="question4">
     <question>Why cannot I build my project with the embedded version of Maven?</question>
     <answer>
By default the IDE builds Maven projects with the embedded version of Maven. That one comes from Sep 2006 and is close/equal to 2.0.4 version of Maven.
Any plugin or project requiring a later version will fail the build. In this situation you need to install the
<a href="http://maven.apache.org/download.html">latest Maven binaries</a>. Then go to Tools/Options dialog and in the Miscellaneous/Maven2 tab
set it's location. You can either mark individual projects or everything to build externally.

     <question>I don't want to get the default license header in newly created files!</question>
     <answer>
See instructions how to setup the <a href="mevenide2-netbeans/customizations.html">netbeans.hint.license</a> property.
     </answer>
   </faq>
   <faq id="question7">
     <question>My generated sources are marked as errors in the editor.</question>
     <answer>
The IDE source code has currently no way to recognize plugins that generate sources and where do they generate them. 
The current solution is to include everything that under target/generated-sources/foobar folders where foobar is usually the name of the plugin. 
Most plugins currently generate sources into these directories by default.
