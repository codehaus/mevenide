			There are many Maven plugins that are available out there 
			and there will be ever more in the future. Making the best
			use of them requires the user to have a good knowledge of the 
			exposed properties.
			<br/>
			Mevenide can help by providing an infrastructure to help Maven 
			Plugins to expose their properties in a easy way.

			To attain that goal Maven plugins providers can declaratively 
			plug into Mevenide preference pages. Screenshot 1 below is an 
			example of that interaction (just a sample so not all properties 
			are displayed in the preferences page) : 
			<br/>
			<center>
				<img border="1px" src="../images/plugins-providers.png"/>
				<br/>
				<font size="-1"><b>Screenshot 1</b> PDE plugin provider</font>
				<br/>
			</center>
			To add a new page, plugins provider have to contribute a new 
			Eclipse plugin that uses the org.mevenide.ui.preference extension 
			point. Please refer to the <a href="extension-point.html" target="_blank">extension point documentation</a>
			for more details.
			<br/>
			A template  for the <a href="http://maven.apache.org/reference/plugins/genapp/">Genapp plugin</a> 
			is available in <a href="http://cvs.mevenide.codehaus.org/mevenide-plugin-provider-genapp/">Mevenide CVS Head</a> 
			for quicker startup.
			<br/>
			However we are aware that all needed informations are already available in the goals.xml and 
			properties.xml documents. So in the near future we will provide a Maven plugin to automatically generate 
			the Eclipse plugin.
