				<p>
					Mevenide issues are managed by <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEVENIDE">Jira</a> that the nice <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> guys have offered to the Codehaus. 
					Bug reporting and RFEs are really needed in order to make the plugin better. However before raising an issue in Jira, please be sure to meet the actual <a href="index.html#Requirements">prerequisites</a>.
					Also please provide relevant enough informations, f.i. by attaching some log to the issue (e.g. ${workspace.dir}/.metadata/.log or looking at the error view, located under <code>Window/Show View/Other.../Pde Runtime</code>) 
					and/or describing the steps involved in case of errors. This will help to diagnosticate the problem and reproduce it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks for <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEVENIDE">reporting</a> !
