			    This project provides the UI part for Eclipse. See the 
			    <a href="features.html" class="documentLink">features list</a> and the <a href="help.html" class="documentLink">Help page</a> 
			    to learn more about Mevenide for Eclipse. Latest release and zipped sources can be 
			    downloaded <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/mevenide/release" class="documentLink">here</a>. 
			    However the preferred way to install Mevenide for Eclipse is through the Eclipse Update Manager ; please refer to 
			    <a href="update/index.html">this document</a> for instructions on using it.
			</p>
			<p>
				Mevenide for Eclipse wont work with Eclipse version 2.x since some APIs and utility classes of the 3.0-stream are used. Also for the POM editor to 
				work you will need at least the 3.0 M9 build. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Current Mevenide release has been tested under WinXP Eclipse 3.0 M9 With JDK 1.4.1 and Maven 1.0-rc3. Please note that JDK 1.4+ is <b>required</b> since Java 1.4 regex Engine is used.
