	<p>
		Mevenide is a work in progress and thus there are a lot 
		of items that need to be worked out. For those who want 
		to help, here is a non exhaustive list of such items. 
		- altho please note that most items listed here are 
		Eclipse related since Eclipse is the only targeted IDE for now.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Provide Extensible Maven Wizard to allow easy creation of different kind of mavenized projects (web , ejb, aspectj, etc.)</li>	
		<li>Split Mevenide preferences page into multiple, context-related, preferences pages</li>
		<li>Provide preferences extension mechanism to allow Maven plugins providers to easily plug into Mevenide</li>
		<li>Provide project properties page that override mevenide preferences </li>
		<li>Provide a really integrated Maven Console</li>
		<li>Provide a MavenBuilder</li>
		<li>Provide a Mevenide Perspective</li>
		<li>Polish the Synchronization feature (perhaps providing a view like the new CVS Synchronize View)</li>
		<li>Finish the POM Editor</li>
		<li>...</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Alternatively the various Maven plugins	created to help the build process could make better and more useful/customizable.
