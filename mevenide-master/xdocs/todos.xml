		Mevenide is a work in progress and thus there are a lot 
		of items that need to be worked out. For those who want 
		to help, here are non exhaustive lists of such items for 
		both Eclipse and Netbeans plugins :
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="mevenide-ui-eclipse/todos.html">Eclipse plugin</a></li>	
		<li><a href="mevenide-netbeans-project/todos.html">Netbeans plugin</a></li>
		<li>JBuilder plugin</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Alternatively the various Maven plugins	created to help the build process could make better and more useful/customizable.
