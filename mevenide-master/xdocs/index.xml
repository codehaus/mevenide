                    <a href="http://maven.apache.org" class="documentLink">Maven</a>aims to make the
                    developer's life easier by providing a well defined project structure,
                    well defined development processes to follow, and a coherent body of documentation that
                    keeps
                    developers and clients apprised of what's happening with your project.

                    Maven alleviates a lot of what most developers consider drudgery and lets them get
                    on with the task at hand. To attain that goal Maven is centred around the notion of
                    Project Object Model (POM),
                    an XML file describing, among other things, the layout of the project. On the other hand
                    every single
                    IDE has its own way of representing the settings needed to build a project. Thus there is
                    a discrepancy that makes both sides
                    harder to maintain and kept in synch.

                    Mevenide aims to integrate Maven into standard IDEs. There are a number of areas that
                    can be worked on such as POM editing, IDE and POM synchronization, launching Maven from
                    within the IDE,
                    providing wizards for mavenized projects, managing Maven runtime properties, etc. Right
                    now Mevenide provides support for
                    <a href="http://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>,
                    <a href="http://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a>,
                    <a href="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder">JBuilder</a>and
                    <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.
