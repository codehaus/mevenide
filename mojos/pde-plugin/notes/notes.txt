1. declare an artifact as "pde-enabled"
  
   an artifact is declared as an eclispe artifact by the way of a _pom_ 
   property :
   
   <project>
     ...
     <properties>
       <pde.enabled>true</pde.enabled>
     </properties>
   </project>
   
2. dependencies duplication issue
   
   to solve the dependencies duplication issue (plugin.xml vs. project.xml)
   pde:classpath goal has to run as a preGoal of build:start
   
   <preGoal name="build:start">
     <pde:classpath />
   </preGal>
   
   it parses plugin.xml and extracts <requires> information and add required 
   plugin to classpath, making them available to compilation process
   
   on the other hand non eclipse dependencies are still declared in the pom
   
   todo: manage single jar'd plugins 
   
3. plugin.xml update
   
   pde:plugin goal has a prereqs on jar:install	 
   
   if an artifact is declared as pde-enabled, pde:plugin goal extracts 
   -relevant- information from the pom and update plugin.xml:
   by default dependencies declared in the pom are added as runtime/library 
   element and are copied into default lib folder
     
     * they may be excluded thanks the maven.pde.exclude property
     * lib folder can be parametrized through the maven.pde.targetPath 
       property
     * they may be rendered as requires/plugin entry by setting the 
       maven.pde.requires property (todo)
     
     <dependency>
       ...
       <properties>
	     <maven.pde.targetPath>antoherLibFolder</maven.pde.targetPath>
         <maven.pde.exclude>true|false</maven.pde.exclude>
         <maven.pde.requires>true</maven.pde.requires>
       </properties>
     </dependency>
     
     pde:plugin then builds a single jar'd plugin and install it in the 
     local repository

5. sites

6. deploy

7. other artifact types
    
   no more  differenciation for other artifact types (help | lib-only):
     - lib-only plugins now are a subset of the previous artifacts set
     - help will be when refined includes will be managed
   
8. convenient archive & other utility goals
   
   - provide a goal to zip a pde artifact ready to be unpacked 
     into eclipse.home
   - provide a goal to directly install a plugin into eclipse.home
