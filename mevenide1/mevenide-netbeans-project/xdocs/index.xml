            <p>Mevenide for the Netbeans 5.0 version works with Maven 1.0.2 and contains these <a href="features.html" class="documentLink"> features </a>.</p>
            <p> You can download the <a href="../download/mevenide-netbeans-1.0.zip"> 1.0 release</a>. It was tested with Maven 1.0.2 and Netbeans IDE 5.0 final. (4.1 should also work with some exceptions, but we encourage you to upgrade to 5.0)</p>
            <p>Reasonable effort is made to have it always working with the latest development builds of Netbeans 5.5. Please note that the grammar module 
            (editor completion for maven xml files) in 1.0 release zip will work
            with the 5.0 and later builds but to get it working with 4.1 you need the <a href="../download/mevenide-netbeans-grammar-0.6.1.nbm">old 4.1 mevenide-grammar nbm </a>. 
            </p>
