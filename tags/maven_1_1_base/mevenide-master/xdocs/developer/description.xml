      <p>
        Mevenide actually comes as three separate modules (plus the maven-eclipse-plugin-plugin) : mevenide-core, 
    	goals-grabber and mevenide-ui-eclipse. This document provides informations about the relationships 
    	between those modules and describes some guidelines developers should follow.
