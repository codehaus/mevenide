					Mevenide issues are managed by <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEVENIDE">Jira</a> that the nice <a href="http://atlassian.com/">Atlassian</a> guys have offered to the Codehaus. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Bug reporting and RFEs are really needed in order to make the plugin better. However before raising an issue in Jira, please be sure to meet the actual <a href="index.html#Requirements">prerequisites</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Also please provide relevant enough informations, f.i. by attaching some log to the issue (e.g. ${workspace.dir}/.metadata/.log or looking at the error view, located under <code>Window/Show View/Other.../Pde Runtime</code>) 
					and/or describing the steps involved in case of errors. This will help to diagnosticate the problem and reproduce it.
				</p>
				<p>
					Thanks for <a href="http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MEVENIDE">reporting</a> !
