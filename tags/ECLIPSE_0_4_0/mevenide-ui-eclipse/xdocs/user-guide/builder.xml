						Since version 0.3.0 Mevenide provides its own nature and builder. Mevenide builder 
						allows to activate/disactivate goals depending on the files that have changed since 
						last Maven run. Mevenide supports also AutoBuild now through the same mechanism. 
						<br/>
						The Builder is associated with the Mevenide Nature and only the projects that have Mevenide 
						Nature can benefit from the features described here.

						Mevenide Nature is merely a marker whose sole purpose is to activate Mevenide Builder for 
						specific projects. Mevenide nature is attached by default to New projects created through 
						the <a href="wizard.html#Maven Project Wizard">"New Maven Project" Wizard</a>. 
						<br/>
						It can added to or removed from a project through the project contextual menu (Screenshot 1).

						Builder activation works in a similar way than regular Maven launch (describe process 
						arguments basedir through the same interface), but requires additional settings to
						specify which files modification will trigger the activation of a particular goal.
						<br/>
						The builder configuration dialog can be popped up through the 'Project' menu (Screenshot 2).

						This brings up a similar dialog than the Mevenide External Tools integration dialog (Figure 2).
						The big difference lies in the third tab : in the 'Patterns tab' you must specify which file modifications 
						will trigger goal activation - eventually you can specify there that the goals should 
						be auto-launched (Screenshot 3).

							<br/>
						</center>
					</p>
					<p>
						The custom configuration will then populate the builder menu ; the goals to be launched being displayed 
						- as opposed as the configuration name (Screenshot 4).

							<br/>
						</center>
						<b>Important</b> <i>Configurations with auto build set to true are not displayed in the menu.</i>
						<br/>
						Items added to the menu are disactivated until a change in the workspace matches the specified pattern,
						then the items will be activated on a per project basis, and will be disactivated once run.
