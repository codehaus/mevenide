        <section name="Overview">
            <p>
                The Mevenide IDEA integration project aims to integrate
                <a href="http://maven.apache.org" class="documentLink">Maven</a>in every possible
                way into
                <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com">JetBrain</a>'s IntelliJ IDEA integrated
                development environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Current integration features include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Specifying a POM file on a per-module basis.</li>
                    <li>
                        An Ant-like tool window displaying each IDEA module's available
                        goals, as defined in
                        <i>maven.xml</i>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Execution of selected goal(s) in a dedicated execution console,
                        much like the standard
                        <i>Run</i>console of IDEA. Each execution
                        can be stopped, or paused.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Specifying a different Maven home than the one defined in your
                        <i>MAVEN_HOME</i>environment variable and PATH.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                The following is a list of features we intend to be implementing over
                the coming months:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bidirectional update between IDEA project and POM</li>

                    <li>A wizard for opening+creating IDEA project from a POM</li>
                    <li>Autolaunch goals on specific project events (compilation, etc)</li>
                    <li>Automatic artifact downloading on need (on project open?)</li>

                        downloading artifacts to the local repository. Searching the repositories
                        for an artifact is also planned.
                    </li>
                    <li>POM text file editor (instead of the UI editor) with smart intellisense.
