                Currently, no version of Mevenide IDEA has been released yet. The 0.1
                release is well underway and should be released in the coming weeks.
                Until then, you are more than welcome to try the snapshot build located
                <a href="http://dist.codehaus.org/mevenide/distributions/mevenide-idea-0.1-SNAPSHOT.zip">here</a>.
                To install it - simply unzip it into your IDEA <i>plugins</i> directory
                (see <a href="installation.html">here</a> for more information).
