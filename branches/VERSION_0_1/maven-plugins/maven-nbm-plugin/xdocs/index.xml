      <p>
      In order to run the plugin, you need to 
      get the nbantext.jar file from netbeans.org. Currently it's not downloadable, you will need to build it from the sources,
      and checkout the nbbuild module from Netbeans' cvs. Then go to nbbuild directory and run ant. 
      Once the nbantext.jar file is created you can about the build.
