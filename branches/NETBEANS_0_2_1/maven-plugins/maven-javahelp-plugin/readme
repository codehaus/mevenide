WARNING
=======
This project is still incomplete and possibly buggy. Use on Your own risk only!


Functionality
-------------
The plugin shall, when ready, generate the following forms of help files from xdocs:
1. Online help
   While sites can be generated using Maven, there is no special support for online
   help (creatin indexes etc.). This should be available later using this plugin.
   Current state: Doing some rudimetary support using the XDOCS plugin, not functional
2. JavaHelp jar files
   Current state: Help files are generated (also indexes). Currently some minor problems
                  with viewing, probably some file locations and paths have to be changed.
   Tasks: There should be support for user-changed index files (especially index.xml),
          as automatic generation will not be always sufficient.
3. PDF files
   Current state: Nothing done yet. Probably there is no need to create a special goal, if
                  everything needed is possible with the PDF plugin.
The default goal is javahelp:javahelp.


Caveats
-------
Currently all the xdocs must be in the same place as where the plugin is called. However,
the idea of this plugin is reusing available resources where possible, as this will also
make it easier to maintain documents, so it will be necessary to be able to create a
references file.
