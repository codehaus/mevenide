    <description>The project could not be loaded by the NetBeans integration. 
    That usually means something is wrong with your POM. Check your project definition XML syntax. In some rare cases it can also
    be caused by the failure in the project loading code. Please check the View/IDE Log file action for error traces in such a case.</description>
