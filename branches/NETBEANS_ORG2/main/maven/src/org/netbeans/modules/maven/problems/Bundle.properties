ERR_MissingJ2eeModule=Maven J2EE support module missing
MSG_MissingJ2eeModule=You are missing the Maven J2EE support module in your installation. That means all J2EE related functionality (like Deployment, File templates and others) is missing.

ERR_MissingApisupportModule=Maven NetBeans Devepoment support module missing
MSG_MissingApisupportModule=You are missing the Maven APIsupport module in your installation. That means all NetBeans development related functionality (like File templates, running of platform application and others) is missing.
