        <p> This project is a concrete implementation of Mevenide Core for Netbeans. See the 
        <a href="features.html" class="documentLink">features list</a>  <!-- and the <a href="help.html" class="documentLink">Help page</a> -->
	    to learn more about Mevenide for Netbeans. </p>
        <p>
        It works with Netbeans 3.5 and later, JDK 1.4.1 and Maven 1.0-rc2. Please note that JDK 1.4+ is <b>required</b> since Java 1.4 regex Engine is used.
        The <a href="../download/mevenide-ui-netbeans-0-1-SNAPSHOT.zip" class="documentLink"> snapshot release </a> can be downloaded.
        </p>
        <p>
        The module is not actively developed anymore, since it's targeted at 3.x series of Netbeans which will be shortly replaced by Netbeans 4.0.
        The new Netbeans version has a completely rewritten project support and currently time and effort is put into integration with future 4.0.
        </p>
        <p> There is another Netbeans module that adds code completion to Maven related xml files. It's a lightweight module independent of the rest of mevenide.
