			     <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> is a Java project management and project comprehension tool. Maven is based on the concept of a project object model (POM) 
			     in that all the artifacts produced by Maven are a result of consulting a well defined model for your project. Builds, 
			     documentation, source metrics, and source cross-references are all controlled by your POM.
			 </p>
			 <p>
			 	 Maven has many goals, but in a nutshell Maven aims to make the developer's life easier by providing a well defined project structure, 
			 	 well defined development processes to follow, and a coherent body of documentation that keeps your developers and clients apprised of 
			 	 what's happening with your project. Maven alleviates a lot of what most developers consider drudgery and lets them get on with the task at hand.
			 </p>

			 	 On the other hand every single IDE has its own way of representing the settings needed to build a project. Thus there is a discrepancy that makes 
			 	 both sides harder to maintain and kept in synch. Mevenide aims at integrating <a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> into standard IDEs, and 
			 	 especially in Eclipse. Please refer to the <a href="features.html" class="documentLink">features list</a> and the 
			 	 <a href="help.html" class="documentLink">Help page</a> to learn more about Mevenide for Eclipse.
