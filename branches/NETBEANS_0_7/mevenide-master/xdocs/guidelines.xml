  			This document describes a list of coding conventions that are required for code submissions 
  			to the project. By default, the coding conventions for most Open Source Projects should follow 
  			the existing coding conventions in the code that you are working on. For example, if the bracket 
  			is on the same line as the if statement, then you should write all your code to have that convention.
  		</p>

  			<br/>
			Below is a list of coding conventions that are specific to Mevenide.
  		</p>
  		<p>  		
			<b>
				If you commit code that does not follow these conventions, you are responsible for also fixing your own code.
