   	      This plugin aims to simplify management of Eclipse plugin artefacts interdependency. It allows to track required plugin version, 
   	      and also to automatically generate feature and site update distribution. Flexibility is attained through the declaration of 
   	      user-defined Ant filter that allows to use custom replacement strings in the templates. 
   	    </p>
   	    <p>
   	      In the near future, maven-eclipse-plugin-plugin will also support fs/ssh/ftp deploiement of generated artefact archives.
