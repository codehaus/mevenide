   	      This plugin aims to simplify management of Eclipse plugin artefacts interdependency. It allows to track required plugin version, 
   	      and also to automatically generate feature and site update distribution. Flexibility is attained through the declaration of 
   	      user-defined Ant filter that allows to use custom replacement strings in the templates. 
   	    </p>
   	    <p>
   	      In the future, maven-eclipse-plugin-plugin may also support fs/ssh/ftp deploiement of generated artifact archives. We're also 
   	      working on a different build mode that will allow to generate eclipse plugins from a stated dependency instead of bundling it as a 
   	      runtime library. 
   	    </p>

          Please refer to <a href="goals.html">this document</a> for a complete list of features.
